# wiki-ankifier
A tool that started solely for converting Wikipedia-style Markdown into Anki compatible markdown. I switched to Obsidian.md however, and added the according functionality to *obsidianfy* Wikipedia markdown code.

Usage is really easy. Copy the markdown source code of the Wikipedia article of your choice, and click the corresponding button in the UI. *Ankifiy* to convert what you've copied into Anki style markdown, *Obsidianfy* for the Obsidian.md equivalent:

Goal of this script is to reduce the *post-processing* of copying Wikipedia content as much as possible.

**Note**
Does not yet work with tables or images. Those will have to be copied seperately. It also seems like the styles in the English and German wikipedia differ slightly, and I'm primarily using the German one. Beats doing everything by hand though!
